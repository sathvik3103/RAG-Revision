       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'samaltman.txt'}, page_content='\\ufeffHow To Be Successful\\nI\\'ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge \\u200e\\namount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the \\u200e\\nformer and end up wanting the latter.\\u200e\\nHere are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier \\u200e\\nto do once you\\'ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) \\u200e\\nand want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to \\u200e\\nanyone.\\u200e\\n\\u200e1. Compound yourself\\u200e\\nCompounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth \\u200e\\ngeneration.\\u200e\\nA medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short \\u200e\\namount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme \\u200e\\nscalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It\\'s worth a lot of effort to find them \\u200e\\nand create them.\\u200e\\nYou also want to be an exponential curve yourself-you should aim for your life to follow an \\u200e\\never-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It\\'s important to move towards a career that \\u200e\\nhas a compounding effect-most careers progress fairly linearly.\\u200e\\nYou don\\'t want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be \\u200e\\nas effective as people who have been doing it for twenty-your rate of learning should \\u200e\\nalways be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more \\u200e\\nand more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, \\u200e\\nbrand, network effects, and managing people.\\u200e\\nIt\\'s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric-\\u200e\\nmoney, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as \\u200e\\nneeded between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if \\u200e\\nsuccessful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.\\u200e\\nMost people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities \\u200e\\ngo to focus on potential step changes.\\u200e\\nI think the biggest competitive advantage in business-either for a company or for an \\u200e\\nindividual\\'s career-is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the \\u200e\\nworld are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that \\u200e\\nthe furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly \\u200e\\nlong-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.\\u200e\\nTrust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.\\u200e\\n\\u200e2. Have almost too much self-belief\\nSelf-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in \\u200e\\nthemselves almost to the point of delusion.\\u200e\\nCultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can \\u200e\\nconsistently deliver results, trust yourself more.\\u200e\\nIf you don\\'t believe in yourself, it\\'s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the \\u200e\\nfuture. But this is where most value gets created.\\u200e\\nI remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He \\u200e\\ntalked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in \\u200e\\nmemory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large \\u200e\\nrockets to Mars. I left thinking \"huh, so that\\'s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.\"\\u200e\\nManaging your own morale-and your team\\'s morale-is one of the greatest challenges of \\u200e\\nmost endeavors. It\\'s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the \\u200e\\nmore ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.  \\u200e\\nMost highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a \\u200e\\ntime when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more \\u200e\\ncompetition.\\u200e\\nSelf-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and \\u200e\\nactively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it\\'s true, and \\u200e\\nthen decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what \\u200e\\nseparates self-belief from self-delusion.\\u200e\\nThis balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.\\u200e\\n\\u200e3. Learn to think independently\\u200e\\nEntrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. \\u200e\\nSchool is not set up to teach this-in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to \\u200e\\ncultivate it on your own.\\u200e\\nThinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to \\u200e\\nexchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast \\u200e\\nways to test these ideas in the real world.\\u200e\\n\\u200e\"I will fail many times, and I will be really right once\" is the entrepreneurs\\' way. You have to \\u200e\\ngive yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.\\u200e\\nOne of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations \\u200e\\nthat seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit \\u200e\\ncomes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.\\u200e\\n\\u200e4. Get good at \"sales\"\\u200e\\nSelf-belief alone is not sufficient-you also have to be able to convince other people of \\u200e\\nwhat you believe.\\u200e\\nAll great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to \\u200e\\ncustomers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring \\u200e\\nvision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution \\u200e\\nability.\\u200e\\nGetting good at communication-particularly written communication-is an investment \\u200e\\nworth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking \\u200e\\nis clear and then use plain, concise language.\\u200e\\nThe best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you\\'re selling. Selling what \\u200e\\nyou truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.\\u200e\\nGetting good at sales is like improving at any other skill-anyone can get better at it with \\u200e\\ndeliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many \\u200e\\npeople treat it as something unlearnable.\\u200e\\nMy other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it\\'s important. When I was first \\u200e\\nstarting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three \\u200e\\ntimes it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the \\u200e\\nother way.\\u200e\\n\\u200e5. Make it easy to take risks\\u200e\\nMost people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important \\u200e\\nbecause it\\'s impossible to be right all the time-you have to try many things and adapt \\u200e\\nquickly as you learn more.\\u200e\\nIt\\'s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don\\'t have much to lose, and you \\u200e\\npotentially have a lot to gain. Once you\\'ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your \\u200e\\nbasic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets \\u200e\\nyou can make where you lose 1x if you\\'re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a \\u200e\\nbigger bet in that direction.\\u200e\\nDon\\'t save up for too long, though. At YC, we\\'ve often noticed a problem with founders that \\u200e\\nhave spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a \\u200e\\ncomfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it \\u200e\\ngets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match \\u200e\\ntheir lifestyle to next year\\'s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. \\u200e\\nIt\\'s easy-and human nature-to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term \\u200e\\nfulfillment.  \\u200e\\nBut when you aren\\'t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on \\u200e\\nthings that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as \\u200e\\nlong as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.\\u200e\\n\\u200e6. Focus\\u200e\\nFocus is a force multiplier on work.\\u200e\\nAlmost everyone I\\'ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about \\u200e\\nwhat to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work \\u200e\\nmany hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn\\'t matter.\\u200e\\nOnce you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of \\u200e\\npriorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very \\u200e\\nsuccessful.\\u200e\\n\\u200e7. Work hard\\u200e\\nYou can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which \\u200e\\nis still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both-you will be \\u200e\\ncompeting with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work \\u200e\\na lot.\\u200e\\nExtreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it\\'s \\u200e\\nperfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, \\u200e\\nmomentum compounds, and success begets success.\\u200e\\nAnd it\\'s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, \\u200e\\nand discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder \\u200e\\nrecently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after \\u200e\\nleaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. \\u200e\\nWorking hard at that should be celebrated.  \\u200e\\nIt\\'s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the \\u200e\\nUS, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world-the amount of energy and \\u200e\\ndrive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new \\u200e\\nbenchmark.\\u200e\\nYou have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own \\u200e\\nstrategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with \\u200e\\npeople you enjoy spending a lot of time with.\\u200e\\nI think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working \\u200e\\nmost of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina \\u200e\\nseems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.\\u200e\\nOne more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work \\u200e\\ncompounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits \\u200e\\nto pay off. It\\'s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is \\u200e\\nfrequently but not always the case when you\\'re young.\\u200e\\n\\u200e8. Be bold\\u200e\\nI believe that it\\'s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of \\u200e\\nsomething exciting and feel that their work matters.\\u200e\\nIf you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of \\u200e\\npeople wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don\\'t be afraid to work \\u200e\\non what you really want to work on.\\u200e\\nIf everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing \\u200e\\ncompany, then do that and don\\'t second guess it.\\u200e\\nFollow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other \\u200e\\npeople too.\\u200e\\n\\u200e9. Be willful\\u200e\\nA big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time-\\u200e\\nmost people don\\'t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.\\u200e\\nPeople have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, \\u200e\\ngiving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching \\u200e\\nanywhere near their potential.\\u200e\\nAsk for what you want. You usually won\\'t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But \\u200e\\nwhen this works, it works surprisingly well.\\u200e\\nAlmost always, the people who say \"I am going to keep going until this works, and no \\u200e\\nmatter what the challenges are I\\'m going to figure them out\", and mean it, go on to \\u200e\\nsucceed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their \\u200e\\nway.\\u200e\\nAirbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn\\'t \\u200e\\nrecommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-\\u200e\\nring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, \\u200e\\nbattle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to \\u200e\\nsurvive long enough for luck to go their way.\\u200e\\nTo be willful, you have to be optimistic-hopefully this is a personality trait that can be \\u200e\\nimproved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.\\u200e\\n\\u200e10. Be hard to compete with\\u200e\\nMost people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete \\u200e\\nwith. This is important, and obviously true.\\u200e\\nBut this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone \\u200e\\nelse, it eventually will be, and for less money.\\u200e\\nThe best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you \\u200e\\ncan do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting \\u200e\\ngood at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but \\u200e\\nyou have to figure out some way to do it.\\u200e\\nMost people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is \\u200e\\nusually a mistake-if you\\'re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be \\u200e\\nhard to compete with.\\u200e\\n\\u200e11. Build a network\\u200e\\nGreat work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with-\\u200e\\nsometimes closely, sometimes loosely-is an essential part of a great career. The size of \\u200e\\nthe network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can \\u200e\\naccomplish.\\u200e\\nAn effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a \\u200e\\nlong period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my \\u200e\\nfour best investments. I\\'m continually surprised how often something good happens to me \\u200e\\nbecause of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.\\u200e\\nOne of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of \\u200e\\nthe people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come \\u200e\\nback to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in \\u200e\\nthose roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I \\u200e\\nhaven\\'t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough \\u200e\\nthat they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.\\u200e\\nEveryone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your \\u200e\\nweaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but \\u200e\\ndon\\'t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. \"I can\\'t do X because I\\'m not good \\u200e\\nat Y\" is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects \\u200e\\na lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary \\u200e\\nteam members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.\\u200e\\nA particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered \\u200e\\ntalent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. \\u200e\\nThe easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to \\u200e\\nimpress you and who doesn\\'t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of \\u200e\\nimprovement, and don\\'t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.\\u200e\\nI try to always ask myself when I meet someone new \"is this person a force of nature?\" It\\'s a \\u200e\\npretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.\\u200e\\nA special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, \\u200e\\nideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to \\u200e\\nbe helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)\\u200e\\nFinally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.\\u200e\\n\\u200e12. You get rich by owning things\\u200e\\nThe biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from \\u200e\\nhigh salaries. Though there are some exceptions-entertainers for example -almost no \\u200e\\none in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary.\\u200e\\nYou get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.\\u200e\\nThis can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or \\u200e\\nother similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead \\u200e\\nof just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.\\u200e\\nThe best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want \\u200e\\nat scale.\\u200e\\n\\u200e13. Be internally driven\\u200e\\nMost people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to \\u200e\\nimpress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.\\u200e\\nFirst, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a \\u200e\\nlot-much more than you realize-if other people think you\\'re doing the right thing. This will \\u200e\\nprobably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else \\u200e\\nwould have done it anyway.\\u200e\\nSecond, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You\\'ll be very focused on keeping up \\u200e\\nwith other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.\\u200e\\nSmart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware \\u200e\\nof it helps, but only a little-you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic \\u200e\\ntrap.\\u200e\\nThe most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to \\u200e\\nimpress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the \\u200e\\nworld. After you\\'ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough \\u200e\\nsocial status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will \\u200e\\ncontinue to drive you to higher levels of performance.\\u200e\\nThis is why the question of a person\\'s motivation is so important. It\\'s the first thing I try to \\u200e\\nunderstand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but \\u200e\\nyou know it when you see it.\\u200e\\nJessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for \\u200e\\nthe first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first \\u200e\\nstarted. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping \\u200e\\npeople, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.\\u200e\\nEventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are \\u200e\\nimportant to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able \\u200e\\nto go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren\\'t obsessed with.\\u200e\\n\\u200e \\u200e\\n\\u200e[1] A comment response I wrote on HN:\\u200e\\n\\nOne of the biggest reasons I\\'m excited about basic income is the amount of human \\u200e\\npotential it will unleash by freeing more people to take risks.\\u200e\\nUntil then, if you aren\\'t born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can \\u200e\\ntake big swings. If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult :(\\u200e\\nIt is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. \\u200e\\nBut I\\'ve witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go \\u200e\\non to incredible success to know it\\'s possible.\\u200e\\nI am deeply aware of the fact that I personally would not be where I am if I weren\\'t born \\u200e\\nincredibly lucky.\\u200e\\n\\nThanks to Brian Armstrong, Greg Brockman, Dalton Caldwell, Diane von Furstenberg, \\u200e\\nMaddie Hall, Drew Houston, Vinod Khosla, Jessica Livingston, Jon Levy, Luke Miles (6 \\u200e\\ndrafts!), Michael Moritz, Ali Rowghani, Michael Seibel, Peter Thiel, Tracy Young and Shivon \\u200e\\nZilis for reviewing drafts of this, and thanks especially to Lachy Groom for help writing it.\\u200e\\n\\n\\n')]"

INTRODUCTION \\n2.1 BACKGROUND \\nIn line with the ENISA’s European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s sixth strategic objective, \\n“Foresight on Emerging and Future Cybersecurity Challenges2”, the Agency seeks to improve \\nthe EU’s cybersecurity resilience, by increasing awareness of future threats and \\ncountermeasures amongst its member states and stakeholders. Fulfilling this objective likewise \\nsupports the other 6 strategic objectives as it provides input on future threats and challenges.  \\nFigure 1: ENISA Strategic Objectives \\n \\nTo achieve this goal, ENISA has applied its methodological framework grounded in foresight \\nresearch and future studies that was developed in 2021.3 The framework, created in \\ncollaboration with an interdisciplinary expert group that included futurists, sociologists, business \\nleaders, cybersecurity experts, and others, will now be used in practice to identify threats and \\nchallenges likely to emerge by 20304. \\nDrawing on the insights of previous ENISA projects and reports including “Looking into the \\nCrystal Ball5” and “Foresight Challenges,” the framework combines foresight methods with \\ncreative thinking approaches and co-creation/innovation methods; it leverages individual skills, \\nknowledge, and reasoning in a collaborative setting. The overarching mission of this framework \\nis to produce insight about the future and to enrich the dialogue between experts with various \\nprofessions and backgrounds.  \\nWe believe that the key to defending the European Union is to prepare for the future; the future \\nis made by us all and therefore to imagine it we need the input of a diverse range of people. \\nBeyond identifying emerging futures, the agency will enable member states and other \\nstakeholders to improve their cybersecurity based on the findings of the foresight exercise.  \\n2.2 PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE  \\nThis study aims to identify and collect information on future cybersecurity threats that could \\naffect the Union’s infrastructure and services, and its ability to keep European society and \\ncitizens digitally secure. It is our intention to arm ENISA stakeholders with new insights with \\nwhich to begin combatting future threats. The outcome generated by this practical application of \\n \\n2 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020) \\n3 (ENISA, Foresight Challenges, 2021). The framework can be found on page 33 of the report. \\n4 (ENISA, Ad-Hoc Working Group on Foresight On Emerging And Future Cybersecurity Challenges, 2021) \\n5 (ENISA, Looking into the crystal ball., 2018) \\n'),\n",

The strategic objectives6 are as follows:  \\n1. Empowered and engaged communities across the cybersecurity ecosystem \\n2. Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies \\n3. Effective cooperation amongst operational actors within the Union in case of massive \\ncyber incidents \\n4. Cutting-edge competencies and capabilities in cybersecurity across the Union \\n5. High level of trust in secure digital solutions \\n6. Foresight on emerging and future cybersecurity challenges \\n7. Efficient and effective cybersecurity information and knowledge management for \\nEurope \\n \\n2.3 TARGET AUDIENCE \\nOur main target demographic for this project are stakeholders from the cybersecurity domain \\nincluding national cybersecurity authorities, national and EU decision makers, experts, and \\npractitioners. We specifically hope to target operational cybersecurity practitioners and response \\nteams, using the identified threats and scenarios to build resilience and response arrays.  \\n \\n \\n \\n6 (ENISA, A trusted and Cyber Secure Europe, 2020) '),\n",

EMERGING \\nCYBERSECURITY THREATS \\nFOR 2030 \\nThe threats identified and ranked within this report represent a range of topics, many of which \\nare already relevant today. The outcomes of this exercise illustrate that in 8 years many of \\ntoday’s threats will remain pressing but will have shifted in character – increased dependencies \\nand the democratization and development of new technologies add complexity to our \\nunderstanding of threats. Our wish for readers of this report is that they are able to recognize \\nshifts in the threat landscape and already begin preparations to ensure security and resilience in \\nthe face of morphing threats. In cybersecurity there is limited leeway to postpone actions that \\naid in the avoidance and mitigation of future risks; one must continuously anticipate \\napproaching threats. These additional measures, however, need not come at the cost of \\nnecessary wide-reaching cybersecurity controls such as education, awareness, patching, etc.  \\nFigure 2: Top 10 threats \\n \\nMethodology \\nThrough a series of workshops and interviews between March and August 2022, with relevant \\nexperts in the PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental) \\nfields, ENISA has identified and ranked 21 threats that will increase in prevalence by 2030. \\n \\n \\n'),\n",

The first, “collaborative exploration,” is a phase of \\ntrend research and information gathering that integrates expert knowledge, feedback, and \\nvalidation. The second phase, “group forecast workshops,” gathered groups of experts with \\nexperience in one of the PESTLE dimensions to further discuss, explore, assess, and prioritize \\nthe identified trends.  \\nThe third phase, “threat identification”, is based on the threat casting7 methodology for \\nidentifying emerging challenges within the next 10 years. To do so, small groups of \\ncybersecurity experts are provided a scenario that combines prioritized trends. The scenarios \\nare an integral part of the work in order to immerse in the future trends, however their \\ndescription specific as it may be, does not influence the exploration and identification of threats. \\nThe scenarios merely serve as a medium to convey the content related to threats. The group \\nexplores this scenario by building personas and writing a short imaginative science fiction \\nessay. The experts then assume an adversarial perspective to explore potential threat actors \\nand vulnerabilities in the described future. This change in perspective enables the group to \\nestablish adversary motivations and define the possible threats.  \\nThe threats identified by the expert participants were then given scores on likelihood, impact, \\nnovelty, and whether the threat has been previously published by ENISA. Novelty is considered \\nin this project in order to prioritize lesser-known threats.  \\n \\n7 (West, 2017) \\n'),\n",

The threat \\nactors are four main groups described in ENISA’s 2022 Threat Landscape Report - state-\\nsponsored actors, cybercrime actors, hackers-for-hire, and hacktivists8.  \\nThe described methods refer to ENISA’s current threat taxonomy9. It divides threats into the \\nfollowing high-level categories: physical attack (deliberate), unintentional damage / loss of \\ninformation or IT assets, disaster (natural), failures/malfunctions, outages, \\neavesdropping/interception/hijacking, nefarious activity/abuse, and legal.

This would lead to global supply chain issues and \\ncan be used by threat actors for political disruptions, financial gains, or espionage. \\nAdversaries may manipulate these software dependencies and development tools by adding \\nbackdoors to the code components. The easiest method for attackers is the manipulation of \\nopen-source libraries. If focusing more on commercial applications, the attackers can gain initial \\naccess through several techniques, including drive-by compromises or social engineering \\nattacks. By placing trojans, droppers or rootkits into the software components of the suppliers, \\nthey can later gain network access to their ultimate target which uses the hardware or software \\ncomponent in their organization. Physical tampering with hardware in their production facilities \\nare also a possibility. This would require the attackers to have physical access (or at the very \\nleast physical proximity) to the hardware component production facility. The attackers would \\ninfiltrate the facilities legitimately by having an insider working at the facilities who would be in \\nan ideal position to tamper with the hardware for the purpose of data or system compromise.  \\nOnce compromised (leaving no trace) a state actor will purchase the manipulated hardware or \\nsoftware, install it across the country, and open themselves up to a very widespread attack. \\nAnother case can be the compromise of a widely used private company with access to sensitive \\ndata, as seen in the SolarWinds incident13.  \\nThreat #1 - Score 25 \\nProbable Threat \\nActors \\nState-sponsored groups, \\ncriminal organizations Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 2, 4 \\nProbable Methods \\nSabotage, Theft, Network \\nReconnaissance, Malicious \\ncode, Abuse of Information \\nLeakage \\nTopics for future SPD \\nTransparency in critical \\ninfrastructure supply chain (2nd \\nand 3rd level), CE Certification \\nschemes, CVD, Awareness \\nraising and education, software \\nbill of materials / Chain of trust \\nProbable Impacts Disruption, Malfunction, Data \\nLoss, Data Leakage Relevant strategic objectives: SO2, SO3, SO5, SO7 \\nSupply chain compromises are very relevant for EU policies \\nthat cross nations and sectors (SO2).

While the application of deepfake technology allows for \\nillicit financial enrichment of criminal groups or individuals, the primary motivation for \\ndisinformation campaigns through faked identities is (geo)political and will likely be \\npredominantly performed by state actors and other politically motivated actors. \\nData sources are now immeasurable; adversaries can train their AI for deepfake attacks14 with a \\nwide range of publicly available videos, pictures, and voice recordings of individuals (even those \\nnot in the public sphere). Biometric facial images are particularly vulnerable to morphing attacks \\nin which the threat actor can, to a high degree of accuracy, impersonate their target. Deepfake \\ntechnology can also create unreal faces that the human eye is unable to differentiate from real \\nfaces. Therefore, adversaries can create realistic avatars that go beyond the current social \\nmedia15 bots that already have elaborate profiles. The bots of the future that can influence \\nelections and public trust also share videos of themselves on social media to participate visibly \\nin the debate.

Furthermore, the actions of private corporations \\nmay not always align with data protection and security requirements.  \\nGovernments (including law enforcement) and private enterprises as part of public-private \\npartnerships can, within their legal boundaries, legitimately collect personal data - including \\nbiometric data. This creates challenges17 for privacy regulators and the public to make sure the \\nlaws that protect their privacy are enforced. Additionally, it requires all entities collecting this \\ndata to have the necessary defence mechanisms in place. Once adversaries gain access to the \\nnetwork, they can engage in automated collection of data, potentially including a command and \\nscripting interpreter as well as APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load \\n(ETL) services in cloud environments.

Furthermore, we \\nwill see a significant increase in the number of smart devices the average user has associated \\nto them (as of 2021, the average person had seven smart devices).18 Because of this, it may \\nbecome exceedingly difficult to maintain and manage all devices, especially from a security \\nperspective. Additionally, the manufacturers of the smart devices will likely be unsuccessful on \\neducating end-users of the need for device maintenance. The fast adoption of IoT and the \\nongoing skill shortage will lead to a lack of knowledge, training and understanding of the cyber-\\nphysical ecosystem by 2030, leading to IT and OT security maintenance issues arising from the \\nmisconfiguration, delayed maintenance, and inadequate end-of-life support of discontinued IoT \\nsoftware. In addition to these issues, threat actors may deploy intelligent attacks using \\ntechniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which may dramatically reduce the \\ndetection rate of cyberattacks. One example of the use of GAN would be to target servers \\ndistributing patches in order to disrupt scheduled updates19.

The end-users communicate through their mobile applications with the smart devices \\nthat are part of their home, transport or other surrounding. Adversaries can try to get initial \\naccess to the mobile devices by biometric spoofing, brute force attacks, or exploiting \\nvulnerabilities on the device. Once they have access to the phone and the legitimate \\ncommunication channels between the end-user phone and the infrastructure, they can tamper \\nwith the smart devices, laterally move to the network or get access to the account that manages \\nthe smart devices.20 In an industrial ecosystem, adversaries could get initial access through \\nemployees by social engineering attack or through their endpoints, move laterally within the \\ncorporate network and look for internet accessible devices that are connected to the industrial \\ncontrol systems. Additionally, attacks could succeed through transient cyber assets that are \\ndeployed with an insecure configuration – including those from third party suppliers and \\npartners. \\nThreat #4 - Score 18 \\nProbable Threat \\nActors \\nState-sponsored groups, cyber \\ncriminals, hacktivists Relevant Scenario(s) Scenario 1, 3, 4 \\nProbable Methods \\nTampering, Failure of \\nCommunication links, Denial of \\nService, Malicious activity, \\nManipulation of Information, \\nTargeted Attacks, Brute force, \\nUnauthorized Physical Access \\nTopics for future SPD \\nGuidelines for securing the \\nIOT21, Certification Schemes, \\nSecure communication \\nstandards, guidelines for \\nsecure storage of data, *  \\nProcesses related to security-\\nby-design, Software bill of \\nmaterials  / Chain of trust, \\nEconomical value of cyber-\\nattacks and cyber security \\nProbable Impacts Malfunction, Failures and Outages, \\nPhysical Damage Relevant strategic objectives: SO3, SO4 \\nIncidents involving legacy equipment typically impact \\ncross-border critical infrastructure (SO3.)

In addition, attackers will try to gain open- and closed-source information \\nto gather organizational and network information to spot legacy systems with known \\nvulnerabilities. For example, a job posting from a local power plant may share the vendor and \\nproduct type for which they need support- this provides threat actors with ample time to \\ninvestigate product-specific vulnerabilities.

This definition was derived from ENISA’s, \\nCISA’s53, and CompTIA’s organizational definitions of threats.   \\nThe potential event or action could be the exploitation of a vulnerability. A vulnerability in this \\ncontext was defined as any system, structure, asset, or population particularly open to attack or \\ndamage. The second characteristic of the threat definition was adverse impact. The team did \\nnot provide any pre-defined impact categories to avoid limiting the workshop participants’ \\ncreativity in identifying the potential impact. Examples of adverse impact were disruption (of \\nservices), financial or physical damage, breach of privacy or decreasing trust of citizens. For the \\nthird part of the definition, the team asked the workshop participants what part of society would \\nbe impacted by the event. Neither of the affected subjects or objects (asset, organization or \\nindividual) were defined narrowly. An asset, therefore, can be understood as anything with \\nvalue – whether that is a technical or intangible asset. An organization could be a private \\ncompany or a governmental organization. The last element of the threat definition was the \\nthreat actor, for which the team had not defined any categories like state-sponsored actors, \\ncriminal groups, or hackers-for-hire. These categories were added to the threats after the threat \\nidentification workshops took place and were combined with potential motivations of the \\nspecified threat actor.  \\n \\n53 (ENISA, Glossary of Terms., 2018) \\n'),\n",

Often \\nused by military strategists, threatcasting is a (2011) foresight methodology59 that draws from \\ntraditional futures studies and military strategic thinking.  The first phase of threat casting \\nconsists of synthesizing research and identifying trends. This part was concluded with the \\nexplorative research and the following PESTLE expert workshops. \\nD.1 SCENARIOS \\nThe next phase in threatcasting is futurecasting, which includes the compilation of the research \\ndata into a model of the future environment. The goal of the next step was to simulate possible \\nfutures and for workshop participants to immerse themselves as deeply as possible within that \\nfuture. Using the insights and documented information from the PESTLE workshops, the project \\nteam prepared and validated a pared down list of trends from which to build scenarios. The \\ngrouped trends and driving factors were crafted into written scenarios to be evaluated by a \\ngroup of cybersecurity professionals.  \\nScenarios are consistent and coherent stories that illustrate visions and simulate a possible and \\nplausible future. In times of uncertainty, innovation and change, the use of scenario planning \\ntechniques becomes increasingly important because of their usefulness when facing ambiguity \\nand complexity. Scenario planning stimulates strategic thinking and helps to overcome the \\nlimitations of thinking60.  They are not meant to be an exact and realistic representation of the \\nfuture - they serve to open the field of vision and to uncover blind spots to discover possible \\nfutures. This scenario development method helped avoid any bias or selection based on impact \\nor priorities. To design the scenarios, the project team numbered the trends that were prioritized \\nby the experts in the PESTLE workshops and decided to develop scenarios based on 5 \\nrandomly selected trends.  \\nEach scenario combined the trends and defined a storyline of a possible future.  \\nD.1.1 Scenario 1 – Blockchain, deepfakes, & cybercrime in a data-rich \\nenvironment \\nIn 2030, distributed ledger61 (blockchain) technology has evolved, thus enabling simultaneous \\naccess, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner through a network spread over \\nmultiple entities or locations. This technology enables interoperability across different virtual \\nplatforms, allowing digital asset collectability and digital proof of ownership. Blockchain \\ntechnology has found widespread use in the financial, logistics, science, and health sectors.  It \\nsignificantly impacts the economy by increasing consumer trust and processing efficiency \\nbecause of its decentralization. \\nOn the other hand, criminal groups have also benefitted from technological advances, such as \\ndistributed ledger technology (e.g. crypto), the darknet, and privacy-focused platforms. New \\ntechnology is used to widen the groups’ negative impact, expand their activities' overall reach, \\nand use technology for sales and collaboration. This development has a major impact on the \\nlegal sector.  \\nDeep fake technology is also widely established and accessible to everyone; it enables the \\ncreation of synthetic content that appears to be authentic. This technology's mainstream use \\nand distribution will transform sectors such as education, art, digital reconstruction, and the \\n \\n59 (ENISA, Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology, 2022) \\n60 (M.

However, its psychological effects will have a major impact on public \\nsafety, election processes, and the spread of disinformation. \\nWhile technological options for privacy are available and widely used, the private sector is \\nhighly dependent on using real-time analysis of customer data from various platforms and \\nsources to create and promote products and understand customer behavior and needs. The \\ndata is constantly recorded, evaluated, analyzed and combined, and processed from various \\nplatforms and sources. Organizations using this method widen their power and have a big \\nimpact on the economy.  \\nIn addition to the widespread collection of customer data, organizations collect data from \\ninfrastructure components via technologies like IoT and drones and analyze it with AI. With this \\ninformation, organizations perform inspections, predict failures, reduce workforce requirements, \\nand maintain (critical) infrastructure. This practice has a significant impact on companies in the \\nwind energy, logistics, insurance, roadway, railway, and telecommunication sectors.  \\nD.1.2 Scenario 2 – Eco-friendly, sustainable, and interconnected smart \\ncities (non-state actors) \\nAs the global population rose and became more prosperous, and the frequency of droughts \\nincreased due to climate change, the diminishing availability of freshwater in 2030 is posing \\nchallenges to all parts of the environment, society, and economy. Crop failures, poor soil quality, \\nincreased fuel consumption, and dependency on hydroelectric power increased62, which led to \\nvery high costs of living and an increase in poverty. Consequently, the level of criminal activities \\nincluding aggressions, robberies, and theft rose dramatically. The increasing energy \\nrequirements and the construction of adequate water infrastructure for the new needs are an \\nintegral part of planning future cities.  \\nAs part of the reconstruction of cities, sectors of infrastructure, mobility, energy, ICT, and \\nhealthcare are actively incorporating technology into their existing environment and using data \\nfor decision making and improvement. Smart cities create safer, more efficient, and sustainable \\ncities that are adapted to the environmental requirements of climate change. However, the \\nincreased use of digital technology into the cities’ infrastructure also increased their \\ntechnological dependence. \\nWith the increasing connectivity and possibilities to collaborate, the political power of non-state \\nactors has continued to grow – broadly impacting both the economy and society.  Digital \\ncommunities, institutions, and other actors are beyond the capacity of the state to control, \\ninfluencing all levels of governance and changing the political environment. In the \\ncommunication sector specifically, telecommunication providers63 have amassed significant \\ngeopolitical, economic, and societal power. Furthermore, as all digitalized processes and \\nservices are dependent on connectivity, both local and transcontinental communication \\nproviders are gaining importance in Europe due to their use of new technology like space \\nconnectivity and drones. \\nThe new factors mentioned above have also affected election ecosystems. Core electoral \\nsystems are being targeted by digital communities, institutions, and actors. However, the scope \\nof vulnerable components also include election administrators, political parties, news \\norganizations, social media platforms, email platforms, and donor groups – all of which have \\nbecome part of broader campaigns to manipulate democracy and call into question the \\ntrustworthiness of elections.  \\n \\n62 (IPCC, 2022) \\n63 Please note that telecommunications providers will not be the only groups amassing huge amounts of power – the \\ngreatest power shift will be towards content providers and hyperscalers.

The delegation of tasks to automated decision-making \\nsystems with little or no human intervention enables new solutions and improves overall \\nefficiency. On the other side, society, and especially sectors like the medical diagnostics sector, \\nthe industry of autonomous vehicles, and financial institutes (to issue loans and credit cards) \\nare fighting ethical challenges. Data-based and automated decision-making could lead to \\ndiscriminatory and biased outcomes, privacy violations, and the undermining of human self-\\ndetermination.  \\n(IoT) devices are the predominant vehicle for decision-making data. In 2030, organizations \\nusing these devices face problems with patch management; it is especially difficult for critical \\ninfrastructure64 providers to update the large number of devices without disruptions or breaches. \\nWith the increasing use of digital products and services, more personal or sensitive data is \\navailable on the Internet. This data includes biometric, genetic, and behavioral information and \\nis tracked across different online platforms. Unfortunately, data breaches, attacks, and online \\nbullying have become part of daily life and impact most EU citizens. This results in a severe \\npublic health risk; victims struggle with PTSD, burnout, anxiety, depression, abuse, or even \\nsuicidal behavior. More and more EU consumers are concerned about how their data is being \\nused online and are calling for increased control over data access and usage rights.  \\nOn the other hand, law enforcement has difficulties accessing stored data or using collected \\ndata because of the implementation of end-to-end encryption of communication channels, \\ncompliance with data privacy regulations, lack of technical capabilities. The implementation of \\ntechnological developments has complicated the ability of law enforcement to gain access to \\nand gather relevant data for criminal investigations. The widespread use of encryption, which \\ncontains many benefits from a privacy and security perspective, is also a development criminals \\nare using to their advantage.  \\nD.1.4 Scenario 4 – Sustainable energy, automated/short-term workforce \\nIn 2030 the use of renewable energy has increased as EU governments and societies seek to \\navoid the rising costs and environmental and political impacts of fossil fuel dependency65. Many \\norganizations automate equipment to harvest such energy, such as solar panel arrays and wind \\ngenerators. These organizations rely on IoT devices to monitor, manage, and perform \\nmaintenance on these assets. This is exposing the EU's energy sector to a variety of \\ncybersecurity challenges.  \\nAs more people move to urban areas, the agriculture sector is automated because of \\ninsufficiently available workforce in rural areas. This leads to increasing dependency on \\ntechnology and specialized skills and knowledge to manage agricultural output of countries. The \\nexposure of agricultural infrastructure and operations to a connected environment leads to \\nchallenges in ensuring food security for the population of EU countries. \\nWith the shortage of skilled workers, non-traditional, flexible work structures like freelancing \\nhave become the norm (e.g., workers in the Gig-economy)66. The labor market is characterized \\nby the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs. The \\nplatformization of work drastically reshapes the labor market, with an extreme gap developing \\nbetween high and low educated people and their income.  \\n \\n64 (Allianz, 2016) \\n65 (Union, 2022) \\n66 (Global, 2022) \"),\n",

To \\nincrease efficiency and reduce costs, the adoption of the everything-as-a-service model is \\nhighly popular and has become an indispensable asset for sustaining businesses. As a result, \\ncompanies have become increasingly dependent on these software service providers. \\nD.1.5 Scenario 5 – Legislation, bias, extinctions, & global threats \\nIn 2030, the world’s population counts 8.5 billion people, with urban growth taking place in \\nregions relatively undisturbed in the last century67. Urban expansion, tropical deforestation, and \\nland-use change sped up mass extinction and the loss of biodiversity. This has caused the loss \\nof food security, soil fertility, an increased water scarcity in Europe.  Natural disasters and \\npandemics have become commonplace. \\nThe internet, once a medium of freedom and expression has increasingly become regulated \\nand censored, democracy itself has atrophied under its influence. Disinformation68 and \\npropaganda disseminated online have poisoned the public sphere and dialogue. The unbridled \\ncollection of personal data has broken down traditional notions of privacy. Moreover, a cohort of \\ncountries are moving toward digital authoritarianism, by embracing extensive censorship and \\nautomated surveillance systems. Europe, targeting to protect its values, has tried to strengthen \\nits technological sovereignty, by reducing dependencies and including social and environmental \\nambitions within its technical legislation. One technology already regulated in 2024 is machine \\nlearning and artificial intelligence, which is massively invested in. However, with the use of AI-\\nbased systems, Europe is being challenged with problems and incidents on data ownership, \\nsovereignty, data protection, and compliance, especially with algorithmic biases. These biases, \\nbased on gender, ethnicity, or sexual identity in AI technology, led to the continuing historical \\nhuman biases and the exacerbation of those biases in societal practices.  \\nSpace has also become the main focus of governments and private investment, as space \\ntechnologies, data and services advanced in the 20s. But the dependence to this critical space \\ninfrastructure in space and on the ground made Europe more vulnerable to both manmade and \\nnatural threats. \\n \\nD.2 SCIENCE FICTION PROTOTYPING (SFP) \\nScience Fiction Prototyping is a “thought-provoking method for arousing discussion in research \\nand foresight of emerging technology.69”  Science fiction prototypes (SFPs) are stories that \\nallow the workshop participants to explore a wide variety of futures and a different angle on \\nthese futures. The SFP is based on a future (scenario), derived from five randomly picked \\ntrends and a character (persona) in this scenario, to emphasize this specific point of view70.  \\nFrom these models of different future environments, the five groups, each containing two to \\nthree cybersecurity experts, were assigned one future model. Based on this model, the group \\nderived one persona and wrote a science fiction prototype (SFP), focusing on the layered \\neffects the future environment has on their persona. To characterize this person, the group \\nimagines a specific person living in that future of the scenario. The group visualizes in a \\npersona template who the character is, their questions, problems, goals, motivations and a \\npossible statement. This step was prepared by the participants and the project team before the \\nworkshop71. \\nThe preliminary work of science fiction prototyping created the basis for the Threat Identification \\nworkshop, where the groups moved their focus from the models of the future environment and \\n \\n67 (Nations, 2022) \\n68 (ENISA, Threat Landscape, 2021) \\n69 (Kymalainen, 2016) \\n70 (Johnson, 2011) \\n71 (Institute, 2021) '),\n",

The participants explored and discussed \\ncybersecurity threats that included the different layers of their science fiction prototype. Based \\non the threat definition – a potential event or action with an adverse impact on an asset, \\norganization or individual, carried out by an actor – the groups formulated and defined different \\ncybersecurity threats of the future.  \\nThese views of the future are effects-based models, meaning that the group is not modelling a \\nspecific threat first; they are exploring the layered effects that this future will have on a single \\nperson, related and an active part in this scenario. This creates a more detailed effects-based \\nmodel that ultimately helps the participants to find more threats but also opens the threat \\ndefinition in broader depth. \\nThe moderators of the project team guided the discussion with questions and, if necessary, \\nrandomly drew Security Cards that served as input for the threat discussion to explore more \\nlayers of potential threats. Security Cards were created by the University of Washington in 2013 \\nand aim to foster creative thinking on cybersecurity threats. There are four dimensions within \\nthe Security Cards – human impact, adversary’s motivations, adversary’s resources, and \\nadversary’s methods72. The Security Cards were drawn by the moderator if the discussion \\nstalled, and the participants were unable to identify new threats. The moderator also \\nencouraged the group to switch perspectives and look at the future environment from the \\nadversary’s position to identify more threats.  \\nThe output of the Threat Identification workshop was a long list of future cybersecurity threats \\nand their descriptions. \\nD.3 THREAT PRIORITIZATION \\nThe final step of the process was the conduction of a Threat Prioritization workshop with ENISA \\nstakeholders, refining the threat descriptions based on ENISA cybersecurity expert’s feedback \\nto the threats and compiling the identified future cyberthreats into the report at hand. The Threat \\nPrioritization workshop’s goal was to rank the threats based on their impact, likelihood, novelty \\nand, therefore, importance for ENISA. Novelty was included to prioritize threats that are not \\noften included in public discourse. This was done in a workshop with ENISA cybersecurity \\nexperts, leading to the emerging cybersecurity threats for 2030 list. (See chapter 4.) Impact and \\nlikelihood were rated on a scale of 1 to 5; these were multiplied to create a baseline score. Then \\n2 points were added if the threat was deemed novel; 2 points were deducted if the threat had \\nalready been published in another ENISA publication.  \\nAfter receiving this feedback, the project team refined the threat descriptions and added the \\nactors, methods, and impact category to each top-ten threat.  \\nThe threat information may be found in chapter 4 and the scoring for the top 10 threats is in \\nAnnex E.  \\n \\n \\n72 (TAMARA DENNING) '),\n",

Introduction\\nA ﬁber graph is a graph on the ﬁnitely many lattice points F ⊂Zd of a polytope where\\ntwo lattice points are connected by an edge if their diﬀerence lies in a ﬁnite set of allowed\\nmoves M ⊂Zd. The implicit structure of these graphs makes them a useful tool to explore\\nthe set of lattice points randomly: At the current lattice point u ∈F, an element m ∈±M\\nis sampled and the random walk moves along m if u + m ∈F and stays at u otherwise.\\nThe corresponding Markov chain is irreducible if the underlying ﬁber graph is connected and\\nthe set M is called a Markov basis for F in this case. This paper investigates the heat-bath\\nversion of this random walk: At the current lattice point u ∈F, we sample m ∈M and move\\nto a random element in the integer ray (u + Z · m) ∩F. The authors of [6] discovered that\\nthis random walk can be seen as a discrete version of the hit-and-run algorithm [15, 26, 16]\\nthat has been used frequently to sample from all the points of a polytope – not only from its\\nlattice points. The popularity of the continuous version of the hit-and-run algorithm has not\\nspread to its discrete analog, and not much is known about its mixing behaviour. One reason\\nis that it is already challenging to guarantee that all points in the underlying set F can be\\nDate: September 12, 2018.\\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation.

However, in many situations where a Markov\\nbasis is known, the heat-bath random walk is evidently fast. For instance, it was shown in [3]\\nthat the heat-bath random walk on contingency tables mixes rapidly when the number of\\ncolumns is ﬁxed. To work around the connectedness issue, a discrete hit-and-run algorithm\\nwas introduced in [1] for arbitrary ﬁnite sets F ⊂Zd. At each step in this random walk, a\\nsubordinate and unrestricted random walk starts at the current lattice point u ∈F and uses\\nthe unit vectors to collect a set of proposals S ⊂Zd. The random walk then moves from u\\nto a random point in S ∩F.\\nRandom walks of the heat-bath type, such as the one presented above, have been studied\\nrecently in [8] in a more general context. In this paper, we explore the mixing behaviour of\\nheat-bath random walks on the lattice points of polytopes with Markov bases. Throughout,\\nwe assume that a Markov basis has been found already and refer to the relevant literature\\nfor their computation [24, 25, 11, 17, 10, 21]. We call the underlying graph of the heat-bath\\nrandom walk a compressed ﬁber graph (Deﬁnition 2.5) and determine in Section 3 bounds on\\nits graph-diameter. We prove that for any A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, the diameter of\\ncompressed ﬁber graphs on {u ∈Nd : Au = b} that use a ﬁxed Markov bases M ⊂kerZ(A) is\\nbounded from above by a constant as b varies (Theorem 3.15). In contrast, we show that the\\ndiameter of conventional ﬁber graphs grow linearly under a dilation of the underlying polytope\\n(Remark 3.9). This gives rise to slow mixing results for conventional ﬁber walks as observed\\nin [27]. In Section 4, we study in more detail the combinatorial and analytical structure\\nof the transition matrices of heat-bath random walks on lattice points and prove upper and\\nlower bounds on their second largest eigenvalues. We also discuss how the distribution on the\\nmoves M aﬀects the speed of convergence (Example 4.21). Theorem 5.8 establishes with the\\ncanonical path approach from [23] an upper bound on the second largest eigenvalue when the\\nMarkov basis is augmenting (Deﬁnition 5.1) and the stationary distribution is uniform. From\\nthat, we conclude fast mixing results for random walks on lattice points in ﬁxed dimension.\\nAcknowledgements.

The natural numbers are N := {0, 1, 2, . . .} and for any N ∈N,\\nN>N := {n ∈N : n > N} and N≥N := {N} ∪N>N. For n ∈N>0, let [n] := {1, . . . , n}. Let\\nM ⊂Qd be a ﬁnite set, then Z·M := {λm : m ∈M, λ ∈Z} and NM is the aﬃne semigroup\\nin Zd generated by M. For an integer matrix A ∈Zm×d with columns a1, . . . , ad ∈Zm,\\nwe write NA := N{a1, . . . , ad}. A graph is always undirected and can have multiple loops.\\nThe distance of two nodes u, v which are contained in the same connected component of a\\ngraph G, i.e. the number of edges in a shortest path between u and v in G, is denoted by\\ndistG(u, v). We set distG(u, v) := ∞if u and v are disconnected. A mass function on a ﬁnite\\nset Ωis a map f : Ω→[0, 1] such that P\\nω∈Ωf(ω) = 1. A mass function f on Ωis positive\\nif f(ω) > 0 for all ω ∈Ω. A set F ⊂Zd is normal if it there exists a polytope P ⊂Qd such\\nthat P ∩Zd = F.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n3\\n2. Graphs and statistics\\nWe ﬁrst introduce the statistical framework in which this paper lives and recall important\\naspects of the interplay between graphs and statistics. A random walk on a graph G = (V, E)\\nis a map H : V × V →[0, 1] such that for all v ∈V , P\\nu∈V H(v, u) = 1 and such that\\nH(v, u) = 0 if {v, u} ̸∈E. When there is no ambiguity, we represent a random walk as an\\n|V | × |V |-matrix, for example when it is clear how the elements of V are ordered. Fix a\\nrandom walk H on G. Then H is irreducible if for all v, u ∈V there exists t ∈N such that\\nHt(v, u) > 0. The random walk H is reversible if there exists a mass function µ : V →[0, 1]\\nsuch that µ(u) · H(u, v) = µ(v) · H(v, u) for all u, v ∈V and symmetric if H is a symmetric\\nmap. A mass function π : V →[0, 1] is a stationary distribution of H if π ◦H = π. For\\nsymmetric random walks, the uniform distribution on V is always a stationary distribution.\\nIf |V | = n, then we denote the eigenvalues of H by 1 = λ1(H) ≥λ2(H) ≥· · · ≥λn(H) ≥−1\\nand we write λ(H) := max{λ2(H), −λn(H)} for the second largest eigenvalue modulus of H.\\nAny irreducible random walk has a unique stationary distribution [14, Corollary 1.17] and\\nλ(H) ∈[0, 1] measures the convergence rate: the smaller λ(H), the faster the convergence.\\nThe aim of this paper is to study random walks on lattice points that use a set of moves.\\nTypically, this is achieved by constructing a graph on the set of lattice points as follows\\n(compare to [7, Section 1.3] and [24, Chapter 5]).\\nDeﬁnition 2.1. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set and M ⊂Zd. The graph F(M) is the graph on\\nF where two nodes u, v ∈F are adjacent if u −v ∈M or v −u ∈M.\\nA normal set F ⊂Zd is ﬁnite and satisﬁes F = convQ(F)∩Zd. A canonical class of normal\\nsets that arise in many applications, is given by the ﬁbers of an integer matrix:\\nDeﬁnition 2.2. Let A ∈Zm×d and b ∈NA. The set FA,b := {u ∈Nd : Au = b} is the b-ﬁber\\nof A. The collection of all ﬁbers of A is PA := {FA,b : b ∈NA}. For M ⊂kerZ(A), the graph\\nFA,b (M) is a ﬁber graph.\\nLet F, M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite. If the membership in F can be veriﬁed eﬃciently – for instance\\nwhen F is given implicitly by linear equations and inequalities – then it is possible to explore\\nF randomly using M as follows: At a given node v ∈F, a uniform element m ∈M is\\nselected. If v + m ∈M, then the random walk moves along m to v + m and if v + m ̸∈M,\\nthe we stay at v. Formally, we obtain the following random walk.\\nDeﬁnition 2.3. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be two ﬁnite sets. The simple walk is the random\\nwalk on F(M) where the probability to traverse between to adjacent nodes u and v is |±M|−1\\nand the probability to stay at a node u is |{m ∈±M : u + m ̸∈F}| · | ± M|−1.\\nThe simple walk is symmetric and hence the uniform distribution is a stationary distribu-\\ntion (see also [27, Section 2]). To ensure convergence, the random walk has to be irreducible,\\nthat is, the underlying graph has to be connected. The following deﬁnition is a slight adaption\\nof the generalized Markov basis as deﬁned in [21, Deﬁnition 1].\\nDeﬁnition 2.4. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd. A ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd is a\\nMarkov basis of P, if for all F ∈P, F(M) is a connected graph.\\n4\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nWe refer to [6, Theorem 3.1] for a proof that for collections PA, a ﬁnite Markov basis\\nalways exists and can be computed with tools from commutative algebra (see also [11] for\\nmore on the computation of Markov bases). We now introduce a construction of graphs on\\nlattice points that also give rise to implementable random walks, but whose edges have far\\nmore reach.\\nDeﬁnition 2.5. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. The compression of the graph\\nF(M) is the graph Fc(M) := F(Z · M).\\nFigure 1. Compressing graphs.\\nCompressing a graph F(M) preserves its connectedness: F(M) is connected if and only\\nif Fc(M) is connected.\\n3. Bounds on the diameter\\nIn general knowledge of the diameter of the graph underlying a Markov chain can provide\\ninformation about the mixing time. For random walks on ﬁber graphs, the chains which we\\nconsider, the underlying graph coincides with the ﬁber graph. In this section, we determine\\nlower and upper bounds on the diameter of ﬁber graphs and their compressed counterparts.\\nFor a ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd and any norm ∥· ∥on Rd, let ∥M∥:= maxm∈M ∥m∥.\\nLemma 3.1. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets, then\\ndiam(F(M)) ≥\\n1\\n∥M∥· max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F}.\\nProof. If F(M) is not connected, then the statement holds trivially, so assume that M is a\\nMarkov basis for F. Let u′, v′ ∈F such that ∥u′ −v′∥= max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F} and let\\nm1, . . . , mr ∈M so that u′ = v′+Pr\\ni=1 mi is a path of minimal length, then ∥u′−v′∥≤r·∥M∥\\nand the claim follows from diam(F(M)) ≥distF(M)(u′, v′) = r.\\n□\\nRemark 3.2. Let F ⊂Zd be a normal set. For all l ∈{−1, 0, 1}d and u, v ∈F we have\\n(u −v)T l ≤∥u −v∥1 and thus widthl(F) := max{(u −v)T l : u, v ∈F} ≤max{∥u −v∥1 :\\nu, v ∈F}. Suppose that u′, v′ ∈F are such that ∥u′ −v′∥1 = max{∥u −v∥1 : u, v ∈F} and\\nlet l′\\ni := sign(u′\\ni −v′\\ni) for i ∈[d], then\\n∥u′ −v′∥1 = (u′ −v′)T · l′ ≤widthl′(F) ≤max{∥u −v∥1 : u, v ∈F} = ∥u′ −v′∥1.\\nThe lattice width of F is width(F) := minl∈Zd widthl(F) and thus Lemma 3.1 gives\\n∥M∥1 · diam(F(M)) ≥width(F).\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n5\\nDeﬁnition 3.3. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd.\\nA ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd is\\nnorm-like for P if there exists a constant C ∈N such that for all F ∈P and all u, v ∈F,\\ndistF(M)(u, v) ≤C · ∥u −v∥. The set M is ∥· ∥-norm-reducing for P if for all F ∈P and all\\nu, v ∈F there exists m ∈M such that u + m ∈F and ∥u + m −v∥< ∥u −v∥.\\nThe property of being norm-like does not depend on the norm, whereas being norm-\\nreducing does.\\nNorm-reducing sets are always norm-like, and norm-like sets are in turn\\nalways Markov bases, but the reverse of both statements is false in general (Example 3.4 and\\nExample 3.5). For collections PA however, every Markov basis is norm-like (Proposition 3.7).\\nExample 3.4. For any n ∈N, consider the normal set Fn := ([2]×[n]×{0})∪{(2, n, 1)} with\\nthe Markov basis {(0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (−1, 0, −1)}. The distance between (1, 1, 0) and (2, 1, 0)\\nin Fn(M) is 2n and thus M is not norm-like for {Fn : n ∈N} (see also Figure 2).\\nExample 3.5. Let d ∈N and consider A := (1, . . . , 1) ∈Z1×d, then the set M := {e1 −ei :\\n2 ≤i ≤d} is a Markov basis for the collection PA. However, M is not ∥·∥p-norm-reducing for\\nany d ≥3 and any p ∈[1, ∞]. For instance, consider e2 and e3 in FA,1 (M). The only move\\nfrom M that can be applied on e2 is e1−e2, but ∥(e2+e1−e2)−e3)∥p = ∥e2−e3∥p. On the other\\nhand, in the case we cannot ﬁnd a move that decreases the 1-norm of two nodes u, v ∈FA,b\\nby 1, we can ﬁnd instead two moves m1, m2 ∈M such that u + m1, u + m1 + m2 ∈FA,b and\\n∥u + m1 + m2 −v∥= ∥u −v∥−2. Thus, the graph-distance of any two elements u and v in\\nFA,b (M) is at most ∥u −v∥1 and hence M is norm-like for PA.\\nFigure 2. The graph from Example 3.4\\nRemark 3.6. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd and M ⊂Zd be norm-like for P.\\nIt follows from the deﬁnition that there exists a constant C ∈Q≥0 such that for all F ∈P\\ndiam(F(M)) ≤C · max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F}.\\nThe proof of our next results uses the Graver basis GA ⊂Zd for an integer matrix A ∈Zm×d\\nwith kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0}. We refer to [4, Chapter 3] for a precise deﬁnition.\\nProposition 3.7. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and M ⊂kerZ(A) be a Markov\\nbasis of PA. Then M is norm-like for PA.\\nProof. Let M be a Markov basis for PA. The Graver basis GA for A is a ﬁnite set which\\nis ∥· ∥1-norm-reducing for PA. Thus, deﬁne C := maxg∈GA diam(FA,Ag+ (M)). Now, pick\\nu, v ∈FA,b arbitrarily and let u = v + Pr\\ni=1 gi be a walk from u to v in FA,b (GA) of minimal\\nlength. Since the Graver basis is norm-reducing for FA,b, there always exists a path of length\\nat most ∥u −v∥1 and hence r ≤∥u −v∥1. Every gi can be replaced by a path in FA,Ag+\\ni (M)\\n6\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nof length at most C and these paths stay in FA,b. This gives a path of length C · r, hence\\ndistFA,b(M)(u, v) ≤C∥u −v∥1.\\n□\\nProposition 3.8. Let P ⊂Zd be a polytope with dim(P ∩Zd) > 0 and let M be a Markov\\nbasis for Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for all i ∈N. There exists a constant C′ ∈Q>0 such that for all\\ni ∈N, C′ · i ≤diam(Fi(M)). If M is norm-like for {Fi : i ∈N}, then there exists a constant\\nC ∈Q>0 such that diam(Fi(M)) ≤C · i for all i ∈N.\\nProof. For the lower bound on the diameter, it suﬃces to show the existence of C′ such that\\nC′ · i ≤max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi} for all i ∈N due to Lemma 3.1. Since dim(P ∩Zd) > 0,\\nwe can pick distinct w, w′ ∈P ∩Zd. For all i ∈N, i · w, i · w′ ∈Fi and hence i · ∥w −w′∥≤\\nmax{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi}.\\nTo show the upper bound, assume that M is norm-like. It suﬃces to show that there\\nexists C ∈Q≥0 such that max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi} ≤i · C by Remark 3.6.\\nNow, let\\nv1, . . . , vr ∈Qd such that P = convQ(v1, . . . , vr) and deﬁne C := max{∥vs −vt∥: s ̸= t}.\\nSince Fi = (i·P)∩Zd ⊂convQ(iv1, . . . , ivr) for all i ∈N, we have max{∥u−v∥: u, v ∈Fi} ≤\\nmax{∥ivs −ivt∥: s ̸= t} ≤C · i.\\n□\\nRemark 3.9. Let A ∈Zm×n with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and let M be a Markov basis for PA.\\nThen M is norm-like due to Proposition 3.7 and thus for all b ∈NA there exists C, C′ ∈Q≥0\\nsuch that\\ni · C′ ≤diam(FA,ib (M)) ≤i · C\\nfor all i ∈N. This generalizes for instance [20, Proposition 2.10] and [27, Example 4.7], where\\nlinear diameters on a ray in NA have been observed. This also implies that the construction\\nof expanders from [27, Section 4] works for every right-hand side b ∈NA.\\nRemark 3.10. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, b ∈NA, and let M be a Markov basis\\nfor PA. Proposition 3.8 provides a new proof that the simple walk on (FA,ib (M))i∈N cannot\\nmix rapidly. The lower bound on the diameter from Proposition 3.8 implies, in general, the\\nfollowing upper bound on the edge-expansion (see for example [9, Proposition 1.30]):\\nh(FA,i·b (M)) ≤|M|\\n\\x12\\nexp\\n\\x12log |FA,i·b|\\nD · i\\n\\x13\\n−1\\n\\x13\\n.\\nIn particular, the edge-expansion cannot be bounded from below by Ω( 1\\np(i))i∈N for a polyno-\\nmial p ∈Q[t] and since (|FA,i·b|)i∈N ∈O(ir)i∈N, the simple walk cannot mix rapidly. In [27],\\nit was shown that the edge-expansion can be bounded from above by O(1\\ni )i∈N, which cannot\\nbe concluded from the upper expression.\\nWe now turn our attention to the diameter of compressed ﬁber graphs.\\nIn particular,\\nwe want to know for which collections of normal sets is their diameter bounded. In general,\\ncompressing a ﬁber graph does not necessarily have an eﬀect on the diameter (Example 3.11).\\nAlthough a low diameter is a necessary condition for good mixing, it is not suﬃcient. For\\ninstance, let Gn be the disjoint union of two complete graphs Kn connected by a single edge.\\nThen diam(Gn) = 3, but h(Gn) ≤1\\nn implies that the simple walk does not mix rapidly.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n7\\nExample 3.11. For any n ∈N, let Fn := {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (n, n)} ⊂Z2. The\\nunit vectors M = {e1, e2} are a Markov basis for {Fn : n ∈N}. However, Fc\\nn(M) = Fn(M)\\nand thus diam(Fc\\nn(M)) = diam(Fn(M)) = 2n is unbounded.\\nLemma 3.12. Let A ∈Zm×d and z ∈kerZ(A). There exists r ∈[2d −2], distinct elements\\ng1, . . . , gr ∈GA, and λ1, . . . , λr ∈N>0 such that z = Pr\\ni=1 λigi and gi ⊑z for all i ∈[r]\\nProof. This is [4, Lemma 3.2.3], although it only becomes clear from the original proof of [22,\\nTheorem 2.1] that the appearing elements are all distinct.\\n□\\nProposition 3.13.

Heat-bath random walks\\nIn this section, we establish the heat-bath random walk on compressed ﬁber graphs. We\\nrefer to [8] for a more general introduction on random walks of heat-bath type. Let F ⊂Zd\\nbe ﬁnite set. For any u ∈F and m ∈Zd, the ray in F through u along m is denoted by\\nRF,m(u) := (u + m · Z) ∩F. Additionally, given a mass function π : F →[0, 1], we deﬁne\\nHπ\\nF,m(x, y) :=\\n(\\nπ(y)\\nπ(RF,m(x))\\n, if y ∈RF,m(x)\\n0\\n, otherwise\\nfor x, y ∈F. For M ⊂Zd and a mass function f : M →[0, 1], the heat-bath random walk is\\n(4.1)\\nHπ,f\\nF,M =\\nX\\nm∈M\\nf(m) · Hπ\\nF,m.\\nThe underlying graph of the heat-bath random walk is the compression Fc(M) and in this\\nsection, we assume throughout that for all m ∈M and λ ∈Z \\\\ {−1, 1}, λ · m ̸∈M. Let us\\nﬁrst recall the basic properties of this random walk (compare also to [6, Lemma 2.2]).\\nAlgorithm 1 Heat-bath random walk on compressed ﬁber graphs\\nInput: F ⊂Zd, M ⊂Zd, v ∈F, mass functions f : M →[0, 1] and π : F →[0, 1], r ∈N\\n1: procedure HeatBath:\\n2:\\nv0 := v\\n3:\\nFOR s = 0; s = s + 1, s < r\\n4:\\nSample m ∈M according to f\\n5:\\nSample vs+1 ∈RF,m(vs) according to RF,m(vs) →[0, 1], y 7→\\nπ(y)\\nπ(RF,m(vs))\\n6:\\nRETURN v1, . . . , vr\\nProposition 4.1. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. Let f : M →[0, 1] and π : F →\\n(0, 1) be mass functions. Then Hπ,f\\nF,M is aperiodic, has stationary distribution π, is reversible\\nwith respect to π, and all of its eigenvalues are non-negative. The random walk is irreducible\\nif and only if {m ∈M : f(m) > 0} is a Markov basis for F.\\nProof. Since for any u ∈F and any m ∈M, Hπ\\nF,m(u, u) > 0, there are halting states and\\nthus Hπ,f\\nF,M is aperiodic. By deﬁnition, π(x)Hπ\\nF,m(x, y) = π(y)Hπ\\nF,m(y, x) and thus Hπ,f\\nF,M\\nis reversible with respect to π and π is a stationary distribution.\\nThe statement on the\\neigenvalues is exactly [8, Lemma 1.2]. Let M′ = {m ∈M : f(m) > 0} and f ′ = f|M′, then\\nHπ,f\\nF,M = Hπ,f′\\nF,M′ and thus the heat-bath random walk is irreducible if and only if M′ is a\\nMarkov basis for F.\\n□\\nRemark 4.2. Analyzing the speed of convergence of random walks with second largest\\neigenvalues does not take the computation time of a single transition into account. From\\na computational point of view, the diﬀerence of the simple walk and the heat-bath random\\nwalk is Step 4 of Algorithm 1. However, we argue that Step 4 can be done eﬃciently in\\nmany cases. For instance, a hard normalizing constant of π cancels out. If π is the uniform\\ndistribution, then one needs to sample uniformly from RF,m(v) in Step 4, which can be done\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n9\\neﬃciently. If the input of Algorithm 1 is a normal set F = {u ∈Zd : Au ≤b} that is given\\nin H-representation, then the length of the ray RF,m(v) can be computed with a number of\\nrounding, division, and comparing operations that is linear in the number of rows of A.\\nThere are situations in which the heat-bath random walk provides no speed-up compared\\nwith the simple walk (Example 4.3). Intuitively, adding more moves to the set of allowed\\nmoves should improve the mixing time of the random walk. In general, however, this is not\\ntrue for the heat-bath walk (Example 4.4).\\nExample 4.3. For n ∈N, consider the normal set\\nFn :=\\n\\x1a\\x14\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n\\x15\\n,\\n\\x14\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n\\x15\\n, . . . ,\\n\\x14\\n1\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n1\\n\\x15\\x1b\\n⊂Q2×n.\\nIn the language of [7, Section 1.1], Fn is precisely the ﬁber of the 2 × n independence model\\nwhere row sums are (n −1, 1) and column sums are (1, 1, . . . , 1).\\nThe minimal Markov\\nbasis of the independence model, often referred to as the basic moves, is precisely the set\\nMn := {v −u : u, v ∈Fn} \\\\ {0}. In particular, the ﬁber graph Fn(Mn) is the complete\\ngraph on n nodes. All rays along basic moves have length 2 and thus the transition matrices\\nof the simple random walk and the heat-bath random walk coincide. There are n · (n −1)\\nmany basic moves and the transition matrix of both random walks is\\n1\\nn(n −1)\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n...\\n...\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb+ (n(n −1) −n)\\nn(n −1)\\n· In.\\nThe second largest eigenvalue is 1 −\\n1\\nn−1 which implies that for n →∞, neither the simple\\nwalk nor the heat-bath random walk are rapidly mixing.\\nExample 4.4. Let F = [2] × [5] ⊂Z2, M = {e1, e2, 2e1 + e2}, and let π be the uniform\\ndistribution on F.\\nSince {e2, 2e1 + e2} is not a Markov basis for F, any mass function\\nf : M →[0, 1] must have f(e1) > 0 in order to make the corresponding heat-bath random\\nwalk irreducible.\\nComparing the second largest eigenvalue modulus of heat-bath random\\nwalks that sample from {e1, e2} and M uniformly, we obtain\\nλ\\n\\x121\\n2Hπ\\nF,e1 + 1\\n2Hπ\\nF,e2\\n\\x13\\n= 1\\n2 < 2\\n3 = λ\\n\\x121\\n3Hπ\\nF,e1 + 1\\n3Hπ\\nF,e2 + 1\\n3Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2\\n\\x13\\n.\\nSo, adding 2e1 + e2 to the set of allowed moves slows the walk down. This phenomenon does\\nnot appear for the simple walk on F, where the second largest eigenvalue modulus improves\\nfrom ≈0.905 to ≈0.888 when adding the move 2e1 + e2 to the Markov basis.\\n=\\n+\\n+\\nFigure 3.

If the moves are selected uniformly, then the heat-bath random walk on\\nF coincides with the Glauber dynamics on F. To see it, choose u ∈F and let\\nF′ := {λ ∈Zd : u + λ1m1 + · · · + λdmd ∈F}.\\nIt is easy to check that F′ is unique up to translation and depends only on F, u, and M.\\nSince the vectors in M are linearly independent, every element of F can be represented by\\na unique choice of coeﬃcients in F′. Thus, the heat-bath random walk on F using M is\\nequivalent to the heat-bath random walk on on F′ using the unit vectors as moves. For any\\nunit vector ei ∈Zd, the ray through an element v ∈F′ is {w ∈F : wj = vj∀j ̸= i} and this\\nis precisely the form desired in the Glauber dynamics [14, Section 3.3.2].\\nFor the remainder of this section, we primarily focus on heat-bath random walks Hπ,f\\nF,M\\nthat converge to the uniform distribution π on a ﬁnite, but not necessarily normal, set\\nF. We particularly aim for bounds on its second largest eigenvalue by making use of the\\ndecomposition from equation 4.1. Our ﬁrst observations consider its summands Hπ\\nF,m that\\ncan be well understood analytically (Proposition 4.6) and combinatorially (Proposition 4.7).\\nProposition 4.6. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set, m ∈Zd, and π : F →[0, 1] be the uniform\\ndistribution. Let R1, . . . , Rk be the disjoint rays through F along m. Then\\n1. Hπ\\nF,m is symmetric and idempotent.\\n2. img(Hπ\\nF,m) = spanR\\nnP\\nx∈R1 ex, P\\nx∈R2 ex, . . . , P\\nx∈Rk ex\\no\\n.\\n3. ker(Hπ\\nF,m) = Lk\\ni=1 spanR {ex −ey : x, y ∈Ri, x ̸= y}.\\n4. rank(Hπ\\nF,m) = k and dim ker(Hπ\\nF,m) = |F| −k.\\n5. The spectrum of Hπ\\nF,m is {0, 1}.\\nProof. Symmetry of Hπ\\nF,m follows from the deﬁnition. By assumption, F is the disjoint union\\nof R1, . . . , Rk and hence there exists a permutation matrix S such that SHπ\\nF,mST is a block\\nmatrix whose building blocks are the matrices\\n1\\n|Ri|\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n...\\n...\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb∈Q|Ri|×|Ri|.\\nThus, Hπ\\nF,m is idempotent and the rank of Hπ\\nF,m is k. A basis of its image and its kernel can\\nbe read oﬀdirectly and idempotent matrices can only have the eigenvalues 0 and 1.\\n□\\nProposition 4.7. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets, π : F →[0, 1] be the uniform\\ndistribution, and let V1, . . . , Vc ⊆F be the nodes of the connected components of F(M), then\\n\\\\\\nm∈M\\nimg(Hπ\\nF,m) = spanR\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nX\\nx∈V1\\nex, . . . ,\\nX\\nx∈Vc\\nex\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\uf8fe.\\nProof. It is clear by Proposition 4.6 that the set on the right-hand side is contained in any\\nimg(Hπ\\nF,m) since any Vi decomposes disjointly into rays along m ∈M. To show the other\\ninclusion, write M = {m1, . . . , mk} and let for any i ∈[k], Ri\\n1, . . . , Ri\\nni be the disjoint rays\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n11\\nthrough F parallel to mi. In particular, {Ri\\n1, . . . , Ri\\nni} is a partition of F for any i ∈[k]. Let\\nv ∈T\\nm∈M img(Hπ\\nF,m).

We show that for any i ∈[k] and any a ∈[c], λi\\nj = λi\\nj′\\nwhen Ri\\nj and Ri\\nj′ are a subset of Va. This implies the proposition. So take distinct x, x′ ∈Va\\nand assume that x and x′ lie on diﬀerent rays of mi and let that be x ∈Ri\\nj and x′ ∈Ri\\nj′ with\\nj ̸= j′. Since x and x′ are in the same connected component Va of F(M), let yi0, . . . , yir ∈F\\nbe the nodes on a minimal path in Fc(M) with yi0 = x and yir = x′. For any s ∈[r], yis\\nand yis−1 are contained in the same ray Rks\\nts coming from a Markov move mks.

For a\\nﬁnite set M ⊂Zd, the graph Fc(M) has the intersecting ray property if all (m, m′) have the\\nintersecting ray property in F.\\nExample 4.14. The compressed ﬁber graph on [n1] × · · · × [nd] ⊂Zd that uses the unit\\nvectors {e1, . . . , ed} as moves has the intersecting ray property. On the other hand, consider\\nF = {u ∈N2 : u1 + u2 ≤1} and take the rays R1 := {(0, 0), (0, 1)} and R2 := {(1, 0)}\\nthat are parallel to e2 and the rays R′\\n1 := {(0, 1)} and R′\\n2 := {(0, 0), (1, 0)} that are parallel\\nto e1.

This is a straightforward extension of the case n = 2 in [12, Theorem 2.4.8.1] and\\nrelies on the fact that commuting matrices are simultaneously triangularizable.\\n□\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n13\\nProposition 4.17. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets and suppose there exists m ∈M\\nsuch that (m, m′) has the intersecting ray property in F for all m′ ∈M′ := M \\\\ {m}. Let\\nV1, . . . , Vc be the connected components of F(M′), πi : Vi →[0, 1] the uniform distribution,\\nand f ′ = (1 −f(m))−1 · f|M′, then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤f(m) + (1 −f(m)) · max{λ(Hπi,f′\\nVi,M′) : i ∈[c]}.\\nProof. Let H := Hπ,f′\\nF,M′ be the heat-bath random walk on F(M) that samples moves from M′\\naccording to f ′, then Hπ,f\\nF,M = f(m)·Hπ\\nF,m +(1−f(m))·H. By assumption, all pairs (m, m′)\\nwith m′ ∈M′ have the intersecting ray property and thus the matrices Hπ\\nF,m and H commute\\naccording to Proposition 4.15. The eigenvalues of all involved matrices are non-negative and\\nthus Lemma 4.16 implies that the second largest eigenvalue of Hπ,f\\nF,M has the form λ + λ′\\nwhere λ ∈{0, f(m)} by Proposition 4.6 and where λ′ is an eigenvalue of (1 −f(m)) · H. The\\nmatrix H is a block matrix whose building blocks are the matrices Hπ,f′\\nVi,M′ = Hπi,f′\\nVi,M′ and thus\\nthe statement follows.\\n□\\nProposition 4.18. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zk be ﬁnite sets. If F(M) has the intersecting\\nray property, then λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1 −min(f).\\nProof. Let M = {m1, . . . , mk}.\\nThe intersecting ray property and Proposition 4.15 give\\nthat the matrices f(m1) · Hπ\\nF,mi, . . . , f(mk) · Hπ\\nF,mk commute pairwise. According to Propo-\\nsition 4.6, the eigenvalues of f(mi) · Hπ\\nF,mi are {0, f(mi)}. Lemma 4.16 gives that the second\\nlargest eigenvalue of Hπ,f\\nF,M, which equals the second largest eigenvalue modulus since all of\\nits eigenvalues are non-negative, fulﬁlls λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) = P\\ni∈I f(mi) for a subset I ⊆[k]. Since\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) < 1 and Pk\\ni=1 f(mi) = 1, we have I ̸= [k] and the claim follows.\\n□\\nProposition 4.19. Let n1, . . . , nd ∈N>1, F = [n1]×· · ·×[nd], and M = {e1, . . . , ed}. Then\\nfor any positive mass function f : M →[0, 1], λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) = 1 −min(f).\\nProof. It is easy to verify that Fc(M) has the intersecting ray property and thus Proposi-\\ntion 4.18 shows λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1−min(f). Assume that min(f) = f(ei). The connected compo-\\nnents of Fc({e1, . . . , ed} \\\\ {ei}) are the layers Vj := {u ∈F : ui = j} for any j ∈[ni] and the\\nrays through F parallel are Rk := {(0, k)+s·ei : s ∈[ni]} for k = (k1, . . . , ki−1, ki+1, . . . , kd) ∈\\n[n1] × · · · × [ni−1] × [ni+1] × · · · × [nd]. In particular, any ray intersects any connected com-\\nponent exactly once.\\nThus, the matrix (|Rk ∩Vj|)k,j is the all-ones matrix, which has a\\nnon-trivial kernel. Proposition 4.12 implies λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≥1 −f(ei).\\n□\\nRemark 4.20. In the special case n := n1 = · · · = nd and f : {e1, . . . , ed} →[0, 1] the\\nuniform distribution in Proposition 4.19, the heat-bath random walk on [n]d is known as\\nRook’s walk in the literature.

Its characteristic polynomial in Q[µ, x] is\\n−1\\n25x4(x −1)(µ + x −1)6(−5x2 + 5x + 2µ2 −2µ)(−5x2 + 5x + 4µ2 −4µ)\\nand hence its eigenvalues are\\nx1(µ) := 1,\\nx2(µ) := 1 −µ,\\nx3(µ) := 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 +\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n,\\nx4(µ) := 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 −\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n,\\nx5(µ) := 1\\n2\\nh\\n1 +\\np\\n1 + 4(µ2 −µ)\\ni\\n,\\nx6(µ) := 1\\n2\\nh\\n1 −\\np\\n1 + 4(µ2 −µ)\\ni\\n.\\nIt is straightforward to check that x5(µ) > 1\\n2 > x6(µ), x3(µ) > 1\\n2 > x4(µ). Since µ2 −µ < 0\\nfor u ∈(0, 1) and x3(µ) ≥x6(µ). We can show that x4(µ) ≥x2(µ) and thus\\nλ(µHπ\\nF,e1 + (1 −µ)Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2) = 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 +\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n.\\nThe fastest heat-bath random walk on F(M) which converges to uniform is thus obtained for\\nµ = 1\\n2, i.e. when the moves are selected uniformly. The second largest eigenvalue in this case\\nis\\n1\\n10(5 +\\n√\\n15) ≈0.887, which is larger than the second largest eigenvalue of the heat-bath\\nwalk that selects uniformly from {e1, e2} (see Proposition 4.19).\\n5. Augmenting Markov bases\\nIt follows from our investigation in Section 3 that the diameter of all compressed ﬁber\\ngraphs coming from a ﬁxed integer matrix A ∈Zm×d can be bounded from above by a\\nconstant. However, Markov moves can be used twice in a minimal path which can make the\\ndiameter of the compressed ﬁber graph larger than the size of the Markov basis. The next\\ndeﬁnition puts more constraints on the Markov basis and postulates the existence of a path\\nthat uses every move from the Markov basis at most once.\\nDeﬁnition 5.1. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set and M = {m1, . . . , mk} ⊂Zd. An augmenting\\npath between distinct u, v ∈F of length r ∈N is a path in Fc(M) of the form\\nu →u + λi1mi1 →u + λi1mi1 + λi2mi2 →· · · →u +\\nr\\nX\\nk=1\\nλikmik = v\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n15\\nwith distinct indices i1, . . . , ir ∈[k]. An augmenting path is minimal for u, v ∈F if there\\nexists no shorter augmenting path between u and v in Fc(M).\\nA Markov basis M for\\nF is augmenting if there is an augmenting path between any distinct nodes in F.\\nThe\\naugmentation length AM(F) of an augmenting Markov basis M is the maximum length of\\nall minimal augmenting paths in Fc(M).\\nNot every Markov basis is augmenting (see Example 3.11), but the diameter of compressed\\nﬁber graphs that use an augmenting Markov basis is at most the number of the moves. For\\nﬁber graphs coming from an integer matrix, an augmenting Markov basis for all of its ﬁbers\\ncan be computed (Remark 5.2).\\nRemark 5.2. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and let b ∈NA. The Graver basis\\nis an augmenting Markov basis for FA,b for any b ∈NA. We claim that when A is totally\\nunimodular, then AGA(FA,b) ≤d2(rank(A) + 1).\\nIn particular, the augmentation length\\nis independent of the right-hand side b.\\nLet u, v ∈FA,b be arbitrary and for i ∈N, let\\nli := min{ui, vi}, wi := max{ui, vi}, and ci := sign(ui −vi) ∈{−1, 0, 1}. Then v is the unique\\noptimal value of the linear integer optimization problem\\nmin{cT x : Ax = b, l ≤x ≤w, x ∈Zd}.\\nA discrete steepest decent as deﬁned in [5, Deﬁnition 3] using Graver moves needs at most\\n∥c∥1 · d · (rank(A) + 1) ≤d2 · (rank(A) + 1) many augmentations from u to reach the optimal\\nvalue v. We refer to [5, Corollary 8] which ensures that every Graver move is used at most\\nonce. Note that in [5], x is constrained to x ≥0 instead to x ≥l, but their argument works\\nfor any lower bound.\\nExample 5.3. Fix d ∈N and consider A and M from Example 3.5. We show that M is an\\naugmenting Markov basis for FA,b for any b ∈N. Let u, v ∈FA,b be distinct, then there exists\\ni ∈[d] such that ui > vi or ui < vi, thus, we can walk from u to u′ := u + (ui −vi)(e1 −ei)\\nor from v to v′ := v + (vi −ui)(e1 −ei). In any case, after that augmentation, the pairs\\n(u′, v) and (v′, u) coincide in the ith coordinate and thus we ﬁnd an augmenting path by\\ninduction on the dimension d. We have used at most d −1 many edges in these paths and\\nhence AM(FA,b) ≤d −1 for all b ∈N.\\nWe now show that the augmentation length is essentially bounded from below by the\\ndimension of the node set and hence the bound observed in Example 5.3 cannot be improved.\\nWe ﬁrst need the following lemma.\\nLemma 5.4. Let v1, . . . , vk ∈Qd such that any v ∈spanQ {v1, . . . , vk} can be represented by\\na linear combination of r vectors. Then dim(spanQ {v1, . . . , vk}) ≤r.\\nProof. Let B ⊂P(v1, . . . , vk) the set of all subsets of cardinality r. By our assumption,\\n∪B∈BspanQ {B} = spanQ {v1, . . . , vk}. Since dim(spanQ {B}) ≤r for all B ∈B and since B\\nis ﬁnite, the claim follows.\\n□\\nProposition 5.5. Let P ⊂Qd be polytope and let M ⊂Zd be an augmenting Markov basis\\nfor Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for all i ∈N. Then dim(P) ≤maxi∈N AM(Fi).\\n16\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nProof. Without restricting generality, we can assume that 0 ∈P. Let V := spanQ {P} be\\nthe Q-span of P, then dim(P) = dim(V ). We must have dim(spanQ {M}) = dim(V ) since\\ndim(P) = dim(convQ(Fi)) for i suﬃciently large and since M is a Markov basis for Fi. Deﬁne\\nr := maxi∈N AM(Fi) and choose any non-zero v ∈V and u ∈relint(P) ⊂Qd. Then there\\nexists δ ∈Q>0 such that u + δv ∈P. Thus, 1\\nδu + v ∈1\\nδP. Let c ∈N≥1 such that i := c\\nδ ∈N\\nand w := c\\nδu ∈Zd. Then w + cv = c(1\\nδ u + v) ∈(i · P) ∩Zd = Fi. By assumption, there exists\\nan augmenting path from w to w + cv using only r elements from M. Put diﬀerently, the\\nelement cv from V can be represented by a linear combination of r vectors from M. Since v\\nwas chosen arbitrarily, Lemma 5.4 implies dim(P) = dim(V ) ≤r.\\n□\\nRemark 5.6. It is a consequence from Proposition 5.5 that for any matrix A ∈Zm×d with\\nkerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and an augmenting Markov basis M, there exists F ∈PA such that\\nAM(F) ≥dim(kerZ(A)).\\nLet us now shortly recall the framework from [23] which is necessary to prove our main\\ntheorem. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. For any ordered pair of distinct nodes (x, y) ∈V × V ,\\nlet px,y ⊆E be a path from x to y in G and let Γ := {px,y : (x, y) ∈V × V, x ̸= y} be\\nthe collection of these paths, then Γ is a set of canonical paths. Let for any edge e ∈E,\\nΓe := {p ∈Γ : e ∈p} be the set of paths from Γ that use e. Now, let H : V × V →[0, 1] be a\\nsymmetric random walk on G and deﬁne\\nρ(Γ, H) := max{|p| : p ∈Γ}\\n|V |\\n· max\\n{u,v}∈E\\n|Γ{u,v}|\\nH(u, v).\\nObserve that symmetry of H is needed to make ρ(Γ, H) well-deﬁned. This can be used to\\nprove the following upper bound on the second largest eigenvalue.\\nLemma 5.7. Let G be a graph, H be a symmetric random walk on G, and Γ be a set of\\ncanonical paths in G. Then λ2(H) ≤1 −\\n1\\nρ(Γ,H).\\nProof. The stationary distribution of H is the uniform distribution and thus the statement\\nis a direct consequence of [23, Theorem 5], since ρ(Γ, H) is an upper bound on the constant\\ndeﬁned in [23, equation 4].\\n□\\nTheorem 5.8. Let F ⊂Zd be ﬁnite and let M := {m1, . . . , mk} ⊂Zd be an augmenting\\nMarkov basis. Let π be the uniform and f be a positive distribution on F and M respectively.\\nFor i ∈[k], let ri := max{|RF,mi(u)| : u ∈F} and suppose that r1 ≥r2 ≥· · · ≥rk. Then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nM,F) ≤1 −\\n|F| · min(f)\\nAM(F) · AM(F)! · 3AM(F)−1 · 2|M| · r1r2 · · · rAM(F)\\n.\\nProof. Choose for any distinct u, v ∈F an augmenting path pu,v of minimal length in Fc(M)\\nand let Γ be the collection of all these paths. Let u + µmk = v be an edge in Fc(M), then\\nour goal is to bound |Γ{u,v}| from above. Let S := {S ⊆[r] : |S| ≤AM(F), k ∈S} and take\\nany path px,y ∈Γ{u,v}. Then there exists S := {i1, . . . , is} with s := |S| ≤AM(F) such that\\nx + Ps\\nk=1 λikmik = y. Since px,y uses the edge {u, v}, there is j ∈[s] such that ij = k and\\nλij = µ. Since |λik| ≤rik, there are at most\\ns! · (2ri1 + 1) · · · (2rij−1 + 1) · (2rij+1 + 1) · · · (2ris + 1) ≤s! · 3s−1\\nY\\nt∈S\\\\{k}\\nrt\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n17\\npaths in Γ{u,v} that uses the edge {u, v} and the moves mi1, . . . , mij−1, mij+1 . . . , mis. Since\\nall the paths are minimal, they have length at most AM(F) so indeed every path in Γ has\\nthat form.\\n|Γu,v|\\nHπ,f\\nF,M(u, v)\\n≤3AM(F)−1\\nP\\nS∈S\\n\\x10\\n|S|!

Bounding |S| rigorously from above\\nby 2|M|, the claim follows from Lemma 5.7.\\n□\\nDeﬁnition 5.9. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. The longest ray through F along\\nvectors of M is RF,M := arg max{|RF,m(u)| : m ∈M, u ∈F}.\\nCorollary 5.10. Let (Fi)i∈N be a sequence of ﬁnite sets in Zd and let πi be the uniform\\ndistribution on Fi. Let M ⊂Zd be an augmenting Markov basis for Fi with AM(Fi) ≤\\ndim(Fi) and suppose that (|RFi,M|)dim(Fi))i∈N ∈O(|Fi|)i∈N.\\nThen for any positive mass\\nfunction f : M →[0, 1], there exists ǫ > 0 such that λ(Hπi,f\\nFi,M) ≤1 −ǫ for all i ∈N.\\nProof. This is a straightforward application of Theorem 5.8.\\n□\\nCorollary 5.11. Let P ⊂Zd be a polytope, Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for i ∈N, and let πi be the\\nuniform distribution on Fi. Suppose that M ⊂Zd is an augmenting Markov basis {Fi : i ∈N}\\nsuch that AM(Fi) ≤dim(P) for all i ∈N. Then for any positive mass function f : M →[0, 1],\\nthere exists ǫ > 0 such that λ(Hπi,f\\nFi,M) ≤1 −ǫ for all i ∈N.\\nProof. Let r := dim(P). We ﬁrst show that (|RFi,M|)i∈N ∈O(i)i∈N. Write M = {m1, . . . , mk}\\nand denote by li := max{|(u + mi · Z) ∩P| : u ∈P} be the length of the longest ray through\\nthe polytope P along mi. It suﬃces to prove that i · (lk + 1) is an upper bound on the\\nlength of any ray along mk through Fi. For that, let u ∈Fi such that u + λmk ∈Fi for\\nsome λ ∈N, then 1\\ni u + λ\\ni mk ∈P and thus ⌊λ\\ni ⌋≤lk, which gives λ ≤i · (lk + 1). With\\nC := max{l1, . . . , lk} + 1 we have |RFi,M| ≤C · i. Ehrhart’s theorem [2, Theorem 3.23]\\ngives (|Fi|)i∈N ∈Ω(ir)i∈N and since |RFi,M| ≤C · i, we have (|RFi,M|r)i∈N ∈O(|Fi|)i∈N. An\\napplication of Corollary 5.10 proves the claim.\\n□\\nExample 5.12. Fix d, r ∈N and let Cd,r := {u ∈Zd : ∥u∥1 ≤r} be the set of integers of the\\nd-dimensional cross-polytope with radius r. The set Md = {e1, . . . , ed} is a Markov basis for\\nCd,r for any r ∈N. We show that Md is an augmenting Markov basis whose augmentation\\nlength is at most d. For that, let u, v ∈Cd,r distinct elements. We claim that there exists\\ni ∈[d] such that xi ̸= vi and ui + (vi −ui) ∈Cd,r. Let S ⊆[d] be the set of indices where u\\nand v diﬀer and let s = r −||u||1. If |S| = 1, then the result is clear so suppose |S| ≥2. If\\nthe result doesn’t hold then for all i ∈S, |vi| −|ui| > s. It follows that\\n∥v∥1 =\\nX\\ni/∈S\\n|ui| +\\nX\\ni∈S\\n|vi| >\\nX\\ni/∈S\\n|ui| +\\nX\\ni∈S\\ns + |ui| = |Suv| · s + ∥u∥1 = (|S| −1) · s + r.\\nBut we assumed that v ∈Cd,r. It follows that for any pair of points u, v in Cd,r, there is a\\nwalk, using the unit vectors as moves, that uses each move at most once. Corollary 5.10 yield\\nthat for any d ∈N, the second largest eigenvalue modulus of the heat-bath random walk on\\nCd,r with uniform as stationary distribution can be strictly bounded away from 1 for r →∞.\\n18\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nThe bound on the second largest eigenvalue in Theorem 5.8 is quite general and can be\\nimproved vastly, provided one has better control over the paths. For example, this can be\\nachieved for hyperrectangles intersected with a halfspace.\\nProposition 5.13. Let a ∈Nd\\n>0, b ∈N, F = {u ∈Nd : aT · u ≤b}, and M := {e1, . . . , ed}.\\nIf π and f are the uniform distributions on F and M respectively, then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1 −|F|\\nd2\\nd\\nY\\ni=1\\nai\\nb .\\nProof. Observe that M is a Markov basis for F since all nodes are connected with 0 ∈F.\\nLet u, v ∈F be distinct. We ﬁrst show that there exists k ∈[d] such that uk ̸= vk and\\nu + (vk −uk)ek ∈F. If u ≤v, the statement trivially holds. Otherwise, there exists k ∈[d]\\nsuch that uk > vk and the vector obtained by replacing the kth coordinate of u by vk remains\\nin F. Now, consider for the following path between u and v: Choose the smallest index\\nk ∈[d] such that uk ̸= vk and such that u + (vk −uk) · ek ∈F and proceed recursively with\\nu + (vk −uk) and v. This gives a path pu,v between u and v of length at most d. Let Γ be\\nthe collection of all these paths. We want to apply Lemma 5.7. Thus, let x ∈F and consider\\nthe edge x →x + c · es. Let us count the paths pu,v that use that edge. Let u, v ∈F and let\\nk1, . . . , kr ∈[d] be distinct indices such that\\nu →u + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 →u + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 + (vk2 −uk2)ek2 →· · · →v\\nrepresents the path pu,v constructed by the upper rule.\\nAssume that pu,v uses the edge\\n{x, x + ces} and let kl = s and (vkl −ukl) = c. In particular,\\nu + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 + · · · + (vkl−1 −ukl−1)ekl−1 = x\\nx + (vkl −ukl)ekl + · · · + (vkr −ukr)ekr = v.\\nWe see that vkt = xkt for all t < l and that ukt = xkt for all t ≥l. In particular, vkl =\\nukl + c = xkl + c is also ﬁxed. The coordinates ukt and vkt are bounded from above by\\nb\\nakt\\nfor all t ∈[r], and hence there can be at most\\n l−1\\nY\\nt=1\\nb\\nakt\\n!\\n·\\n \\nr\\nY\\nt=l+1\\nb\\nakt\\n!\\n.\\nSince k1, . . . , kt are distinct coordinate indices, we have\\n|Γx,x+c·es|\\nHπ,f\\nF,M(x, x + c · es)\\n≤d ·\\nd\\nY\\ni=1\\nb\\nai\\n.\\nLemma 5.7 ﬁnishes the proof.\\n□\\nIn ﬁxed dimension, Proposition 5.13 leads to rapid mixing, but for d →∞, no statement\\ncan be made. In [19], it was shown that the simple walk with an additional halting probability\\non {u ∈Nd : atu ≤b} ∩{0, 1}d has mixing time in O(d4.5+ǫ). For zero-one polytopes, simple\\nand heat-bath walk coincide and we are conﬁdent that a similar statement holds without the\\nrestriction on zero-one polytopes.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n19\\nThe heat-bath random walk mixes rapidly when an augmenting Markov basis with a small\\naugmentation length is used.\\nWe think that it is interesting to question how might an\\naugmenting Markov bases be obtained and how their augmentation length can be improved.\\nQuestion 5.14. Let M be an augmenting Markov basis of A. Can we ﬁnd ﬁnitely many\\nmoves m1, . . . , mk such that the augmentation length of M∪{m1, . . . , mk} on FA,b is at most\\ndim(kerZ(A)) for all b ∈NA?\\nReferences\\n1.
